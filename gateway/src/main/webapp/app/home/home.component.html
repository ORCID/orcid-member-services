                    <p>The ORCID Member Portal is a new suite of tools intended to help institutions make the most of their ORCID membership.
                        To make sure that it functions properly and supports members’ needs, we’re running a pilot test program, and we’re thrilled that your organization is interested in participating.</p>
                    <p> The Member Portal is under active development and will eventually include tools that allow you to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Add/update data on researchers' ORCID records</li>
                        <li>Manage your organization's ORCID membership information</li>
                        <li>Manage your organization's ORCID API credentials</li>
                        <li>Access data and reports</li>

                            <td>"Add affiliations" simplifies the process of adding affiliation information (employment, education, etc) to ORCID records by allowing you to add and update affiliation information on behalf of your researchers using a CSV file, without any need to integrate ORCID directly into your current systems or to acquire an ORCID-enabled vendor system.
